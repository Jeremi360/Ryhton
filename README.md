# Sharpy

My own programing langue.
Inspired by Python, CSharp and GDScript
plus my own ideas that I didn't saw in any langue.

## Sharpy Concepts

- divide your code to rule it
- every thing is public
- every thing is overrideable
- expandable enums at runtime
- `static` like in **C#** 
- `if` is also a `switch` from other c-like langues
- getset like in **C#**
- only easy to understand sugar code, **non** lambdas
- `skip` instead of confusing `continue` in `for` loop
- `wait` instead of confusing `yield`
- commas (`,`) are optional
- blocks of code starts with `:` and contunie by indent
- keywords `use`, `as` and `hide` can be used
  to differentiate between values and functions with
  that same name, but form different scripts
